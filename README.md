## Usage

To generate your custom HTML file, simply type 'node index.js' into the terminal. Upon entering, you will be prompted to ask specific questions about your employees. If you type an invalid input, these will be returned to you as errors, so that you can check your input and try again. Once a profile is completed, you will be prompted with multiple choice options, either to 'Add an engineer', 'Add an intern', or 'Finish building the team'. Once you have finsihed inputting the relevant team members, you can then select the latter, upon which, an HTML page will be built for you and presented in the 'output' folder as the file 'team.html'.
